# ImageCaptioning

Computer Vision - Course Project 
Instructor: Prof. Rob Fergus

Describing an image is an easy and obvious task for humans. Computers find it challenging to do the same as they require to understand the content of an image and to describe that understanding in a natural language. The problem of making machines to automatically caption an image is referred as “Image Captioning”. I present a CNN-LSTM based framework to solve this problem. This model achieves a BLEU-4 score of 20.98 points on MSCOCO dataset which trails human base line by 0.72 BLEU-4 points. Experiments show that the captions generated are mostly sensible and human understandable.
